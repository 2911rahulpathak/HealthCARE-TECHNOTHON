## Outline of Idea

**Imagine a country where the government has introduced its health policy for the treatment and cure of rare diseases.**
**We have created a web portal/page which displays:**
- The nominal information regarding the policy. 
- A form for the patients where they would provide their details like income, age, address, disease diagnosed, phone number, etc. 
- Another form will be for donations. The donors would provide their details and would donate an amount, payment methods include Cryptocurrency (under development).

## Solution Provided

1. Eases load on government to setup registration portal framework
2. Provides first step to access to government aided treatment
